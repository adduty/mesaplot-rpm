.SH NAME
.BR MESAplot
\- A graphical and dynamical interface written in python for plotting MESA data, v0.3.4

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mesaplot
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B MESAplot
is an open-source, graphical and dynamical interface written in python for plotting MESA data. It is a replacement for the mathematica-based MESAFace. It uses wxPython, matplotlib, and numpy. One of our major goals in creating this new software was to make something very easy to install and use for both research and educational purposes.

.B MESAplot
replaces MESAFace. 
It is very similar to its predecessor MESAFace, but it is written in Python and is completely open source. 
It is also a little faster than MESAFace and it will grow to be much better.

The interface is graphical and dynamical. The use is very intuitive and should require no specific instructions.
